      <h2>Dynamic Elements</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript will be used to create an interactive budget calculator. Users will input their income and expense categories, and the script will calculate their leftover balance. Depending on the result, a message will appear to encourage or warn the user. A rotating financial tip or quote will display on the home page every time it loads.
